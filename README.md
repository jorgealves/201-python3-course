In part one, we will cover the following intermediate modules and topics:

    > argparse (Parsing command line arguments)

    > collections (Replacements for Python's standard containers, such

    > as tuple, list and dict)

    > contextlib (Context Managers)

    > functools (Partials, function overloading, etc)

    > importing and importlib

    > iterators and generators

    > itertools (Creating your own iterators)

    > Regular Expressions

    > Type Hinting

In Part two, we will be learning what generators and iterators are as well as how they work. We'll also be looking at some of Python's special functions, like **map** and **filter**. There will be a section on Unicode, encoding and decoding strings, benchmarking and more in this section.

Part three will cover working with websites in Python. We'll look at how to browse a website with Python and scrape some data. We will work with various Python APIs to access major websites. We will use Python to create a client and a server. Finally we'll play around with Python's FTP capabilities.

Part four is all about testing your code. We will look at Python's doctest, unittest and mock modules. We'll also learn about some 3rd party packages that you can use for testing, such as tox, nose and pytest.
